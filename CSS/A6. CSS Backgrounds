CSS Backgrounds

The CSS background properties are used to define the background effects for elements.

In these chapters, you will learn about the following CSS background properties:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position
CSS background-color
The background-color property specifies the background color of an element.

Example
The background color of a page is set like this:

body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
With CSS, a color is most often specified by:

a valid color name - like "red"
a HEX value - like "#ff0000"
an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"
Look at CSS Color Values for a complete list of possible color values.

Other Elements
You can set the background color for any HTML elements:

Example
Here, the <h1>, <p>, and <div> elements will have different background colors: 

h1 {
  background-color: green;
}

div {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

p {
  background-color: yellow;
}
Opacity / Transparency
The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element. It can take a value from 0.0 - 1.0. The lower value, the more transparent:

opacity 1

opacity 0.6

opacity 0.3

opacity 0.1

Example
div {
  background-color: green;
  opacity: 0.3;
}
Note: When using the opacity property to add transparency to the background of an element, all of its child elements inherit the same transparency. This can make the text inside a fully transparent element hard to read.

Transparency using RGBA
If you do not want to apply opacity to child elements, like in our example above, use RGBA color values. The following example sets the opacity for the background color and not the text:

100% opacity

60% opacity

30% opacity

10% opacity

You learned from our CSS Colors Chapter, that you can use RGB as a color value. In addition to RGB, you can use an RGB color value with an alpha channel (RGBA) - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An RGBA color value is specified with: rgba(red, green, blue, alpha). The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).

Tip: You will learn more about RGBA Colors in our CSS Colors Chapter.

Example
div {
  background: rgba(0, 128, 0, 0.3) /* Green background with 30% opacity */
}

CSS background-image
The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.

By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.

Example
Set the background image for a page: 

body {
  background-image: url("paper.gif");
}
Example
This example shows a bad combination of text and background image. The text is hardly readable: 

body {
  background-image: url("bgdesert.jpg");
}
Note: When using a background image, use an image that does not disturb the text.

The background image can also be set for specific elements, like the <p> element:

Example
p {
  background-image: url("paper.gif");
}

CSS Background Repeat
CSS background-repeat
By default, the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically.

Some images should be repeated only horizontally or vertically, or they will look strange, like this:

Example
body {
  background-image: url("gradient_bg.png");
}
If the image above is repeated only horizontally (background-repeat: repeat-x;), the background will look better:

Example
body {
  background-image: url("gradient_bg.png");
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
}
Tip: To repeat an image vertically, set background-repeat: repeat-y;

CSS background-repeat: no-repeat
Showing the background image only once is also specified by the background-repeat property:

Example
Show the background image only once:

body {
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
In the example above, the background image is placed in the same place as the text. We want to change the position of the image, so that it does not disturb the text too much.

CSS background-position
The background-position property is used to specify the position of the background image.

Example
Position the background image in the top-right corner: 

body {
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
}

CSS Background Attachment
CSS background-attachment
The background-attachment property specifies whether the background image should scroll or be fixed (will not scroll with the rest of the page):

Example
Specify that the background image should be fixed:

body {
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
  background-attachment: fixed;
}
Example
Specify that the background image should scroll with the rest of the page:

body {
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
  background-attachment: scroll;
}

CSS Background Shorthand
CSS background - Shorthand property
To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property. This is called a shorthand property.

Instead of writing:

body {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
}
You can use the shorthand property background:

Example
Use the shorthand property to set the background properties in one declaration:

body {
  background: #ffffff url("img_tree.png") no-repeat right top;
}
When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position
It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order. Note that we do not use the background-attachment property in the examples above, as it does not have a value.
