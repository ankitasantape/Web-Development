What is a Promise?
A promise is something that introduce in ES6 and behaviour and expectations are same as its name.
So, a promise is basically that promising to do something.
A promise is an object that eventually indicate the success and failure of an asynchronous task.

Why?How promises help?
Chaining Request: 
So, promises actually save us from callback help.
Callback is actually a scenario that happened when end up calling lot of Chaining asynchronous Request

S0, this is what we call it as callback help, means we are calling one request after the other.
$.ajax({
    success: function(){
        $.ajax({
            success: function(){
                $.ajax(){

                }
            }
        })
    }
})
 
 To avoid this Chaining, promises help us in this kind of situation
 If any promise is unsuccessful you will get into catch
 Code is lot more readable
        promise1.then().then().then().catch()

        checkUserLoggedIn().then(fetchUserFeed).then(fetchUserFriends).then(fetchUserMessages)
